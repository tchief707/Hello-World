**Purpose:**  
Visuals convert complex concepts into clear, structured, and digestible information.

---

### Key Aspects

- **Simplification and Clarity**  
  Visuals simplify complex ideas by providing a blueprint clearer than text alone.  
  They turn abstract system concepts into understandable workflows and structures.

- **Enhanced Communication and Collaboration**  
  Diagrams provide a shared understanding for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.  
  They align teams on design logic and system interactions.

- **Documentation and Decision-Making**  
  Visuals serve as system references for maintenance and upgrades.  
  They also aid decision-making on scalability and performance by showing data flow and architecture.

---

### Examples

- Flowcharts  
- UML Diagrams  
- Architectural Diagrams  
- Screenshots  
- Diagramming Tools
